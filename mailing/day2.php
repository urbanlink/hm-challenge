Day 4/5
Hey arn,

People who make stuff are a unique breed. We're the kind of people who can't sleep at night because our minds are buzzing with new ideas.

BTW: welcome back! This is Day 3 of the 2016 Maker Challenge.

Sometimes the more we think about an idea, the more grandiose it gets. Before we know it, we're planning a project that could take months to finish.

Small wins first

I've already received dozens of emails from people in this year's Maker Challenge. They're pumped. They can't wait to start making stuff.

But let's avoid the temptation to bite off more than we can chew. Let's start with something small.

Why?

First: we don't want to get burnt out right out of the gate. Let's pace ourselves!

Second: we can always iterate on our small thing and make it bigger. But it's a lot harder to make a big thing small.

Derek Sivers said it best:

“Starting small puts 100% of your energy into solving real problems for real people.”

Today's action step

Look over your list of ideas from Day 1 (here's mine as an example). What's something small you could start with? I'd make it a project that takes no longer than a week (it's fine if it's something as small as a blog post, sketch, or rough prototype).

Feel free to send your first idea to me if you'd like me to take a look at it.
