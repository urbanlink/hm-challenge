<strong>Hoi,</strong>
<p>You have a list of ideas to make this year. It's time to put the first three in your calendar.

Work in sprints

I like to schedule my time in weekly sprints. A "sprint" is working on one project for 5-7 days. At the beginning of the week you decide what you're going to achieve, and at the end of the week you review what you were able to ship.

I use a Kanban board to write out a list of achievable tasks for the week. I put all those items in the “Backlog” column. Then, each day I pull up the list, choose one task (by moving it to the “Current” column), and work on it until it’s done.

Action step: schedule it!

For my first month, I know I'd like to work on 4 small ideas. So I'm scheduling them like this:

Week 1: project 1
Week 2: project 2
Week 3: project 3
Week 4: project 4
However, for my second month, I'd like to focus on a bigger idea. It's going to take 4 weeks to build it. My schedule for that month looks like this:

Week 1: milestone 1
Week 2: milestone 2
Week 3: milestone 3
Week 4: milestone 4
What are you going to work on first? Put it in your calendar!
